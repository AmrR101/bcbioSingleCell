# Initialize Seurat (`r bcbName`)

Let's convert our `bcbioSCFiltered` class object containing the filtered high-quality cells into a `seurat` class object. Interally, this begins by calling `CreateSeuratObject()` without any additional filtering cutoffs, since we already applied them during our quality control analysis. Here we are passing the raw gene-level counts of the filtered cells into a new `seurat` object, using `as()` object coercion. Next, global-scaling normalization is applied to the raw counts with `NormalizeData()`, which (1) normalizes the gene expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, (2) multiplies this by a scale factor (10,000 by default), and (3) log-transforms the result. `FindVariableGenes()` is then called, which calculates the average expression and dispersion for each gene, places these genes into bins, and then calculates a z-score for dispersion within each bin. This helps control for the relationship between variability and average expression. Finally, the genes are scaled and centered using the `ScaleData()` function.

```{r seurat}
seurat <- as(bcb, "seurat")
```


## Visualize cells

We already cell filtering cutoffs during our initial quality control analysis using `filterCells()`. Here we are using [Seurat][]'s `VlnPlot()` function to double check the number of UMI counts (`nUMI`), genes detected (`nGene`), and relative mitochondrial abundance (`mitoRatio`). These violin plots should match up with the histograms and bar plots in the quality control report.

```{r qc_plots_1}
features <- c("nUMI", "nGene", "mitoRatio")
sapply(seq_along(features), function(a) {
    VlnPlot(
        seurat,
        features.plot = features[[a]],
        x.lab.rot = TRUE) %>%
        show
}) %>%
    invisible
```

Here we are visualizing UMI count correlations with genes detected (`nGene`) and mitochondrial abundance (`mitoRatio`). These scatterplots should resemble the figures presented in the quality control report.

```{r gene_plot}
GenePlot(seurat, "nUMI", "nGene")
GenePlot(seurat, "nUMI", "mitoRatio")
```


## Plot variable genes

```{r variable_gene_plot}
VariableGenePlot(seurat)
```



# Regress out unwanted sources of variation

Your single-cell dataset likely contains "uninteresting" sources of variation. This can include technical noise, batch effects, and/or uncontrolled biological variation (e.g. cell cycle). Regressing these signals out of the analysis can improve downstream dimensionality reduction and clustering [@Buettner2015-ur]. To mitigate the effect of these signals, [Seurat][] constructs linear models to predict gene expression based on user-defined variables. The scaled z-scored residuals of these models are stored in the `seurat@scale.data` slot, and are used for dimensionality reduction and clustering.


## Cell-cycle scoring

First, we assign each cell a score, based on its expression of G2/M and S phase markers. These marker sets should be anticorrelated in their expression levels, and cells expressing neither are likely not cycling and in G1 phase. We assign scores in the `CellCycleScoring()` function, which stores S and G2/M scores in `seurat@meta.data`, along with the predicted classification of each cell in either G2M, S or G1 phase.

```{r cell_cycle_markers}
ccm <- str_match(metadata(bcb)$organism, "^([A-Z])[a-z]+ ([a-z]+)$") %>%
    .[, 2:3] %>%
    as.character %>%
    paste0(collapse = "") %>%
    tolower %>%
    bcbioSingleCell::cellCycleMarkers[[.]]
s.genes <- ccm %>%
    .[.$phase == "S", "symbol"]
g2m.genes <- ccm %>%
    .[phase == "G2/M", "symbol"]
rm(ccm)
```

```{r cell_cycle_scoring}
seurat <- CellCycleScoring(
    seurat,
    g2m.genes = g2m.genes,
    s.genes = s.genes)
# Cell-cycle `Phase` column should now be added to `seurat@meta.data`
```

Here we are checking to see if the cells are grouping by cell cycle. If we don't see clear grouping of the cells into `G1`, `G2M`, and `S` clusters on the PCA plot, then it is recommended that we don't regress out cell-cycle variation. When this is the case, remove `S.Score` and `G2M.Score` from the variables to regress (`varsToRegress`) in the RMarkdown YAML parameters.

```{r cell_cycle_pca_1}
RunPCA(
    seurat,
    pc.genes = c(s.genes, g2m.genes),
    do.print = FALSE) %>%
    PCAPlot(group.by = "Phase")
```


## Apply regression variables

Here we are regressing out variables of uninteresting variation, using the `vars.to.regress` argument in the `ScaleData()` function. When variables are defined in the `vars.to.regress` argument, [Seurat][] regresses them individually against each gene, then rescales and centers the resulting residuals. We generally recommend minimizing the effects of variable read count depth (`nUMI`) and mitochondrial gene expression (`mitoRatio`) as a standard first-pass approach. If the differences in mitochondrial gene expression represent a biological phenomenon that may help to distinguish cell clusters, then we advise not passing in `mitoRatio` here. When regressing out the effects of cell-cycle variation, include `S.Score` and `G2M.Score` in the `vars.to.regress` argument. Cell-cycle regression is generally recommended but should be avoided for samples containing cells undergoing differentiation.

```{r scale_data, results="hide"}
seurat <- ScaleData(seurat, vars.to.regress = params$varsToRegress)
```

Now that regression has been applied, let's recheck to see if the cells are no longer clustering by cycle. We should now see the phase clusters superimpose.

```{r cell_cycle_pca_2}
RunPCA(
    seurat,
    pc.genes = c(s.genes, g2m.genes),
    do.print = FALSE) %>%
    PCAPlot(group.by = "Phase")
```



# Perform linear dimensional reduction

Next, we perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the scaled data with `RunPCA()`. By default, the genes in `seurat@var.genes` are used as input, but can be defined using the `pc.genes` argument. We have typically found that running dimensionality reduction on highly variable genes can improve performance. However, with UMI data — particularly after regressing out technical variables — we often see that PCA returns similar (albeit slower) results when run on much larger subsets of genes, including the whole transcriptome.

`ProjectPCA()` scores each gene in the dataset (including genes not included in the PCA) based on their correlation with the calculated components. Though we don't use this further here, it can be used to identify markers that are strongly correlated with cellular heterogeneity, but may not have passed through variable gene selection.  The results of the projected PCA can be explored by setting `use.full = TRUE` for `PrintPCA()`.

```{r run_pca}
seurat <- seurat %>%
    RunPCA(do.print = FALSE) %>%
    ProjectPCA(do.print = FALSE)
```

```{r print_pca}
PrintPCA(
    seurat,
    pcs.print = 1:params$pcCompute)
```

We can visualize these genes graphically using `VizPCA()`.

```{r viz_pca, fig.height=30, fig.width=10}
VizPCA(seurat, pcs.use = 1:params$pcCompute, font.size = 1, nCol = 3)
```

In particular, `PCHeatmap()` allows for easy exploration of the primary sources of heterogeneity in a dataset, and can be useful when trying to decide which PCs to include for further downstream analyses. Both cells and genes are ordered according to their PCA scores. Setting `cells.use` to a number plots the "extreme" cells on both ends of the spectrum, which dramatically speeds plotting for large datasets. Though clearly a supervised analysis, we find this to be a valuable tool for exploring correlated gene sets.

```{r pc_heatmap, fig.height=30, fig.width=10}
PCHeatmap(seurat,
          do.balanced = TRUE,
          pc.use = 1:params$pcCompute)
```



# Determine statistically significant principal components

To overcome the extensive technical noise in any single gene for scRNA-seq data, [Seurat][] clusters cells based on their PCA scores, with each PC essentially representing a "metagene" that combines information across a correlated gene set. Determining how many PCs to include downstream is therefore an important step. To accomplish this, we plot the standard deviation of each PC as an elbow plot with `PCElbowPlot()`.

PC selection — identifying the true dimensionality of a dataset — is an important step for [Seurat][], but can be challenging/uncertain. We therefore suggest these three approaches to consider:

1. Supervised, exploring PCs to determine relevant sources of heterogeneity, and could be used in conjunction with GSEA for example.
2. Implement a statistical test based on a random null model. This can be time-consuming for large datasets, and may not return a clear PC cutoff.
3. **Heuristic approach**, using a metric that can be calculated instantly.

```{r pc_use}
pcUse <- params$pcUse
if (!is.numeric(params$pcUse)) {
    pcUse <- pcCutoff(seurat) %>%
        seq(from = 1, to = .)
}
```



# Cluster the cells

Seurat now includes an graph-based clustering approach. Importantly, the *distance metric* which drives the clustering analysis (based on previously identified PCs) remains the same. However, our approach to partioning the cellular distance matrix into clusters has dramatically improved. Our approach was heavily inspired by recent manuscripts which applied graph-based clustering approaches to scRNA-seq data [SNN-Cliq, Xu and Su, Bioinformatics, 2015] and CyTOF data [PhenoGraph, Levine et al., Cell, 2015]. Briefly, these methods embed cells in a graph structure - for example a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph, with edges drawn between cells with similar gene expression patterns, and then attempt to partition this graph into highly interconnected ‘quasi-cliques’ or ‘communities’. As in PhenoGraph, we first construct a KNN graph based on the euclidean distance in PCA space, and refine the edge weights between any two cells based on the shared overlap in their local neighborhoods (Jaccard distance). To cluster the cells, we apply modularity optimization techniques [SLM, Blondel et al., Journal of Statistical Mechanics], to iteratively group cells together, with the goal of optimizing the standard modularity function.

The `FindClusters()` function implements the procedure, and contains a `resolution` argument that sets the "granularity" of the downstream clustering, with increased values leading to a greater number of clusters. We find that setting this parameter between `0.6`-`1.2` typically returns good results for single cell datasets of around 3K cells. Optimal resolution often increases for larger datasets. The clusters are saved in the `seurat@ident` slot.

Regarding the value of the `resolution` argument, use a value `< 1` if you want to obtain fewer clusters.

```{r find_clusters, results="hide"}
seurat <- FindClusters(
    seurat,
    dims.use = pcUse,
    force.recalc = TRUE,
    print.output = TRUE,
    resolution = params$resolution,
    save.SNN = TRUE)
```

A useful feature in [Seurat][] v2.0 is the ability to recall the parameters that were used in the latest function calls for commonly used functions. For FindClusters, we provide the function PrintFindClustersParams to print a nicely formatted formatted summary of the parameters that were chosen.

```{r print_find_clusters_params}
PrintFindClustersParams(seurat)
```



# Run non-linear dimensional reduction (tSNE)

[Seurat][] continues to use tSNE as a powerful tool to visualize and explore these datasets. While we no longer advise clustering directly on tSNE components, cells within the graph-based clusters determined above should co-localize on the tSNE plot. This is because the tSNE aims to place cells with similar local neighborhoods in high-dimensional space together in low-dimensional space. As input to the tSNE, we suggest using the same PCs as input to the clustering analysis, although computing the tSNE based on scaled gene expression is also supported using the `genes.use` argument.

```{r run_tsne}
seurat <- RunTSNE(
    seurat,
    dims.use = pcUse,
    do.fast = TRUE)
assignAndSaveData(paste(bcbName, "seurat", sep = "_"), seurat)
```

```{r print_tsne_params}
PrintTSNEParams(seurat)
```

```{r tsne_plot}
sapply(seq_along(groupBy), function(a) {
    TSNEPlot(seurat,
             do.label = TRUE,
             group.by = groupBy[[a]],
             label.size = 6)
}) %>%
    invisible
```

Note that tSNE is not PCA! The measurement of distance in a tSNE plot is difficult to interpret, and is most helpful for the relationships of close neighbors. To better infer separation distance between the putative clusters, let's reapply PCA.

```{r pca_plot}
sapply(seq_along(groupBy), function(a) {
    PCAPlot(seurat,
            do.label = TRUE,
            group.by = groupBy[[a]])
}) %>%
    invisible
```



# Cluster quality control

Let's look at the variance in the number of UMI counts (`nUMI`), gene detection (`nGene`), and the percentage of mitochondrial gene expression (`mitoRatio`), to see if there are any obvious cluster artefacts.

```{r qc_plots_2}
colors <- c("grey", "purple")
features <- c("nUMI", "nGene", "mitoRatio")
sapply(seq_along(features), function(a) {
    JoyPlot(
        seurat,
        features.plot = features[[a]],
        x.lab.rot = TRUE) %>%
        show
    VlnPlot(
        seurat,
        features.plot = features[[a]],
        x.lab.rot = TRUE) %>%
        show
    FeaturePlot(
        seurat,
        cols.use = colors,
        features.plot = features[[a]])
}) %>%
    invisible
```
