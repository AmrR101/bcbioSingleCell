# 0.0.16

- Support for CRAN version of Seurat.
- Improved documentation of package NAMESPACE in `bcbioSinglecell-package.R` file.
- Offloaded `download()` functionality to basejump package, to avoid collisions with bcbioRnaseq package. Function has been renamed to `externalFile()`.
- Removed function deprecations to simplify the NAMESPACE.
- Improved cellranger sample matching. With these changes the internal `.detectPipeline()` function is no longer needed.
- Improved sample directory matching in internal `.sampleDirs()` function.
- Updated paths to cellranger MatrixMarket files in internal `.readSparseCounts()` function.
- Updated use of `packageSE()` to `prepareSE()`, matching the corresponding basejump function change.
- Renamed internal use of `filter()` to `tidy_filter()`, to avoid future NAMESPACE collisions with ensembldb package.
- Renamed `bcbioSCSubset` class to `bcbioSCFiltered` class.
- Fixed memory issue in `plotZeroesVsDepth()` for datasets with high cell counts.
- Improved sample matching for `selectSamples()`. Will attempt to migrate this to bracket-based subsetting in a future update.
- Restricted sample selection with `selectSamples()` to only work on `bcbioSCFiltered` class for the time being. We can add bracket-based subsetting or S4 method support in `selectSamples()` to properly work on `bcbioSCDataSet` class in a future update.
- Updated RMarkdown template settings and simplified the setup chunks.
- Initial support for `bcbioSCFiltered` class coercion to monocle `CellDataSet` class.
- Suggest scater and scone packages for additional quality control and visualization.
- Require monocle >= 2.5.0.
- Added initial support for viridis color palette in quality control plots.
- Suggest rmarkdown and scde packages.
- Initial commit of subsetPerSample() function.
- Miscellaneous RMarkdown template improvements.



# 0.0.15

- Renamed functions in lowerCamelCase from snake_case.
- Draft support for monocle, scater, and scone.
- Package now depends on SummarizedExperiment.
- Renamed loadRun() to loadSingleCellRun() for improved compatibility with bcbioRnaseq package. This helps avoid NAMESPACE collisions between packages.
- Improved support for custom GTF files.
- Split out cellranger import into a separate utility function named loadCellRanger().
- Added plotZerosVsDepth() by @roryk.
- Renamed filteringCriteria to filterParams in metadata slot.
- Miscellaneous documentation fixes.
